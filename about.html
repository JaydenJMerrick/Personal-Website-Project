                    <h2>My Orgins</h2>
                    <p>Born in Wausau Wisconsin, I've lived In Wisconsin all my life. I attended DC. Everest Senior High school and graduated at the top of my class as Valedictorian. I first job was at my local Kwik Trip for which I saved up to attend University. </p>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am an undergraduate student working towards my Bachelors in Computer Science and Certificate in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have a interest in biology, specially genetics, bioinformatics, and using programming to solve big biological datasets! As I work towards my degree, I enjoy developing projects and getting involved with campus clubs. My career goal is to work in research to fields relating to Bioinformatics or Computational Biology. </p>

                    <h2>Computer Science and Project Development</h2>
                    <p>My interest in computer science started in high school with my curiosity of computers and passion for programming. I enjoyed making small projects, making calculators and websites for fun. During my Senior year I completed my goal of completing Harvard's free online course, CS50.</p>
                    <h2>Machine Learning and Research</h2>
                    <p>My goal after sophomore year of college was to experiment with a focuses within the field of Computer Science. This is the time where I found an interest in AI/Machine Learning and its application to research. Although I admit I have much to learn, my curiosity for Machine Learning is at a all time high. I enjoy learning more about it through building personal projects and attending conferences.</p>
                    <h2>Biology and Bioinformatics</h2>
                    <p>Once I began looking into computer science research, I first found the subject of bioinformatics and thought it looked very interesting. I signed up biology classes the following semester! I hope to expand more into a concentration of biology and put get a niche specialty in bioinformatic research.</p>
